# Yoga & More

Yoga & More is a website that aims to inspire people to come and enjoy yoga, pilates and meditation in Helsingborg, Sweden. The site is targeted towards people who want a small studio with a pleasant, calm and relaxing setting for their classes. Yoga & More will be useful for people to be able to find out what times different classes are, who leads the class, how to get in touch, and where the studio is located.

A link to the live website can be found [here](https://mariechessler.github.io/yoga-and-more/index.html), and a link to the repository [here](https://github.com/MarieCHessler/yoga-and-more).

## Design

*** 

<br>

![Yoga & More 5 color palette](assets/images/ym-5-color-palette.webp)

### Color Palette

* The site's primary colors are (from left to right) Dark Jungle Green, Independence, Taupe Grey, Old Lavender and Isabelline, as seen in the picture above. They were derived using the online tool [Coolors](https://coolors.co), to complement each other in a good way, and still making contrasts possible.
    * Dark Jungle Green is used for text and menu, for best contrast on white
    * Independence is used for dark backgrounds
    * Taupe Grey is used as hover color and for Classes icons
    * Old Lavender is used for the logo
    * Isabelline is used instead of white for text and headings on dark background <br><br>
* The colors are all soft, to mirror the feeling in the studio and the colors in the hero image

<br>

### Typography

* Raleway is used for text and menu, since it it easy to read. Fallback font is sans-serif
* Montez is used for logo and headings, since it fits well with the soft feeling of yoga, pilates and meditation. Fallback font is sans-serif
* Both fonts are from Google Fonts, where they are considered to be a popular pairing

<br>

### Layout

* The majority of the content is placed in sections on the main page, rather than on separate pages. The reason is that not all content would fill a whole page, and thus result in a lot of white space or a footer too high up on the page
* The image gallery has been placed on a separate page, called Our Classes, since it takes up a lot of space
* For desktop layout the content has been divided into up to four columns, for tablet at least one column less, and for mobile at least two columns less, depending on content and page.

<br>

### Wireframes

* The wireframes were used to structure the page content for desktop, tablet and mobile screens. The structure differs between screen sizes, for the user to be able to see and access the content properly.
