<h1>Yoga & More</h1>
<p>Yoga & More is a website that aims to inspire people to come and enjoy yoga, pilates and meditation in Helsingborg, Sweden. The site is targeted towards people who want a small studio with a pleasant, calm and relaxing setting for their classes. Yoga & More will be useful for people to be able to find out what times different classes are, who leads the class, how to get in touch, and where the studio is located.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The site's primary colors are (from left to right) Dark Jungle Green, Independence, Taupe Grey, Old Lavender and Isabelline, as seen in the picture above. They were derived using the online tool <a href="https://coolors.co" target="_blank">Coolors</a>, to complement each other in a good way, and still making contrasts possible.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Dark Jungle Green is used for text and menu, for best contrast on white</li>
                <li>Independence is used for dark backgrounds</li>
                <li>Taupe Grey is used as hover color and for Classes icons</li>
                <li>Old Lavender is used for the logo</li>
                <li>Isabelline is used instead of white for text and headings on dark background</li>
            </ul>
        <li>The colors are all soft, to mirror the feeling in the studio and the colors in the hero image</li>
    </ul>
